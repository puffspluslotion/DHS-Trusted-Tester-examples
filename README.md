These are just some examples from the DHS Trusted Tester practice exam (v5.1.3). Each pdf shows a practice question and if there is an associated exam web page, the link is below it. 
As I have no relationship with the DHS, I can't guarantee the links will remain active

Some notes about the exam as of 9/1/2024
-The real exam is slightly harder than the practice exam overall and includes some new practice webpages so make sure you have a reasonable understanding of why practice exam answers are what they are
-About 50% of the real exam questions are pulled straight from the practice exam potential questions and pages so having these files quickly available to you during test taking can help considerably.
-There do seem to be some issues with practice exam questions being incorrect or slightly subjective. In particular, 1.3.2-content-order-meaning-css 
is showing incorrect for pass despite DHS members on the message board sying that it should be the correct answer. It also shows incorrect for fail and the example pages have css meaning Does Not Apply should be invalid.
-There also seems to be some disagreement over whether two rows of identical links count as "multiple ways" as DHS representatives have said that doesn't count but the practice exam clearly marks that as a pass.
Unfortunately, as you can't review the final exam questions after the test, I have no idea how those particular questions are graded for pages not appearing on the practice exam

-Good Luck
